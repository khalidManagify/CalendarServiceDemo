This is a demo calendar service. Below are the steps we can add to improve

1. Preserve the booked time slots in a datastore like database
2. Add a API Gateway like Azure APIM, the FE will invoke gateway, then gateway can call the servcie
3. Add User Authentication and app authorization with an oAuth provider like Azure AD B2C
4. Add a feature to cancel the booked time slot
5. Add a cron job to check the booked time slots and send a reminder to the user before the booked time slot
6. Add a feature to reschedule the booked time slot
7. Host the service in a container like Docker and deploy it in a container orchestration service like Azure Kubernetes Service
